# 🚕 Uber Ride Allocation Strategy – Academic Project

This project analyzes Uber trip data to identify high-lag zones and improve ride allocation using SQL, Power BI, and data visualization. The aim was to simulate better assignment logic and reduce passenger wait times through rule-based modifications.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To explore Uber ride patterns and propose operational strategies that:
- Identify high-latency zones
- Highlight delay patterns by time and region
- Suggest improvements in vehicle assignment logic
- Improve average ride assignment efficiency

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- 📍 Zone-level ride lag analysis
- 🕒 Delay breakdown by hour of day and trip type
- 🚦 Heatmaps of high-demand locations
- 🔁 Rule-based allocation improvements (proximity + time windows)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** – Data extraction and transformation
- **Power BI** – Dashboards for delay visualization and performance metrics
- **Excel** – Raw data cleanup and mapping
- **Academic Dataset** – Simulated Uber data (public)

---

## 👩‍💼 My Role

- Queried ride-level data to calculate average assignment delays
- Defined KPIs for peak hour lag and regional bottlenecks
- Proposed rule-based allocation logic based on location clusters
- Visualized findings and presented strategy to academic reviewers

## 📉 Outcomes

- 🚗 Identified key delay zones with 20% higher average lag
- 🧠 Proposed logic reduced simulated wait time by 12%
- 📊 Improved assignment transparency for dispatchers
